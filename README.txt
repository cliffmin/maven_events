Events are read in the following JSON format.

     {
       "firstName": "test first name",
       "lastName": "test last name",
       "description": "test description",
       "end_time": "2014-03-05T14:12:29.031Z",
       "is_discrete": false,
       "orbit_numbers": [
         1234
       ],
       "source": "test source",
       "start_time": "2014-03-05T14:12:29.031Z",
       "tags": [
         "test tag"
       ]
     }

     having trouble with the arrays, they get passed as strings
     popular tags feature
     better filter
     better show layout
